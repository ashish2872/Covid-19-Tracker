The first case of the 2019â€“20 coronavirus pandemic in India was reported on 30 January 2020, originating from China. Experts suggest the number of infections could be much higher as India's testing rates are among the lowest in the world. The infection rate of COVID-19 in India is reported to be 1.7, significantly lower than in the worst affected countries.

The outbreak has been declared an epidemic in more than a dozen states and union territories, where provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 have been invoked, and educational institutions and many commercial establishments have been shut down. India has suspended all tourist visas, as a majority of the confirmed cases were linked to other countries.

On 22 March 2020, India observed a 14-hour voluntary public curfew at the instance of the prime minister Narendra Modi. The government followed it up with lockdowns in 75 districts where COVID cases had occurred as well as all major cities. Further, on 24 March, the prime minister ordered a nationwide lockdown for 21 days, affecting the entire 1.3 billion population of India.

The World Health Organisation chief executive director of health emergencies programme Michael Ryan said that India had "tremendous capacity" to deal with the coronavirus outbreak and, as the second most populous country, will have enormous impact on the world's ability to deal with it.Other commentators worried about the economic devastation caused by the lockdown, which has huge effects on informal workers, micro and small enterprises, farmers and the self-employed, who are left with no livelihood in the absence of transportation and access to markets. The lockdown was justified by the government and other agencies for being preemptive to prevent India from entering a higher stage which could make handling very difficult and cause even more losses thereafter.


According to a study at Shiv Nadar University, India could have witnessed a surge of 31,000 cases of disease between March 24 and April 14 without lockdown.


The website is made, so that this becomes a handy tool to every citizen of India which will track dynamic data and will tell the recent scenario of this disease.

The website shows the data :

i. Confirmed cases in India
ii. Death cases in India
iii.Recovered cases in India
iv. Active cases in India
v. Confirmed cases all over the world
vi.Death cases all over the world
vii.Recovered cases in world
viii.Total covid19 tests took place in the World
ix. Rise in Covid19 cases per day in the world
x. Confirmed vs Recovered vs deaths in India
xi. Recovery rate in India
xii.Mortality rate in India
Xiii. Fatality rate in India
xiv. Age probability of getting attacked by the virus in India
xv. gender probability of getting attacked by the virus in India
xvi. Total no. of covid19 tests took place in India
xvii.Negative vs positive test results in India
xviii. No. of testing centres in India, statewise

All the above points sums up my website. None of the points are static. All are dynamic and the plot changes as the government data changes.
